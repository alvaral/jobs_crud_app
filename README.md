# Jobs CRUD App

Simple app that creates, read, upload and delete (CRUD) data from Firebase. Its just a list of random jobs. It uses Firebase Auth and Firestore.

This app is made from a Flutter & Firebase Crash Course (codeWithAndrea), which is the first chapter - [Flutter & Firebase Masterclass](https://codewithandrea.com/courses/flutter-firebase-masterclass/)

## Getting Started
